Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it.

We're an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We're a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling.

When working toward a decision or a new solution, we actively listen to one another, approach it with a “yes, and” mentality, and assume positive intent. Once a decision is made, we align and champion it as one team.



Changing healthcare doesn’t happen overnight. We reflect and learn from challenges and approach the future with a determination to strive for better. In the face of daunting situations, we value persistence. We embrace failure as a stepping stone to future success. On this journey, we seek to act with guts, resilience, initiative, and tenacity.



Healthcare is complicated and personal. We work tirelessly to meet the goals of our clients while also delivering the best experience to our members. We recognize that no matter the role or team, we each play a crucial part in our members’ care and take that responsibility seriously. When faced with an obstacle, we are kind, respectful, and solution-oriented in our approach. We hold ourselves accountable to our clients and our members’ success.

We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease.

Our Software Engineers deliver high-value products for our customers, and infrastructure that enables our business to scale.

Vanta’s team and technology surface are growing quickly, and it’s essential that we invest in the right abstractions and systems to enable us to scale with our business.

As a software engineer on the Self Serve Team, you’ll be a part of the platform organization at vanta, and will work horizontally across many areas of the Vanta product.

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

At Netflix, our mission is to connect global stories with audiences worldwide. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story or a game that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.

Beyond connecting global stories with existing audiences, we also aim to reach new subscribers and increase engagement through innovative marketing campaigns. By crafting compelling and targeted marketing strategies, we strive to capture the attention of potential members and convert their interest into subscriptions. Additionally, we focus on increasing conversation and excitement about Netflix and our content, creating buzz and anticipation that encourages both current and prospective members to explore and engage with our diverse offerings.

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order; however, the Promo Media Algo team, with assistance from creative supervision and member feedback data, have built tools & processes that use technologies like Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to enable our creators to tell the best version of the story they want while allowing our studio to scale further.

As enterprises integrate LLMs into their existing applications, traditional observability tools fall short in addressing the unique safety and operational risks posed by LLM interactions. These tools are adept at monitoring conventional metrics like rate limits, latency, and cost breakdowns but lack the capacity to assess the stochastic risks inherent in LLM inputs, outputs, and inter-LLM communications. This gap represents the primary barrier to confidently deploying LLMs in enterprise settings. At ThirdLaw, we empower IT and Security teams with the tools to answer the foundational question; ""Is this OK?"" and take decisive action when it isn't. We provide the next-generation monitoring solutions necessary to evaluate, investigate, and mitigate the unique risks associated with LLM deployments.



AI is reshaping software development, enterprise knowledge management, and the way work gets done. By giving IT and Security professionals the tools to make sure AI is doing everything it should, and nothing it shouldn’t, you’ll be enabling the safest path to a wave of incredible AI-powered innovation. In this role, you will develop software that supports continuous LLM evaluation and control. You will develop infrastructure needed to serve and scale AI-powered applications, emphasizing the integration of AI and ML algorithms into real-time products.













Join us as we pursue our mission to unlock the boundless possibilities of generative AI by ensuring AI trust and safety. We're looking for people who bring thoughtful ideas and aren't afraid to challenge the norm. Our team is small and focused, valuing autonomy and real impact over titles and management. We need strong technical skills, a proactive mindset, and clear written communication, as much of our work is asynchronous.

We’re building the software infrastructure that enables hospital-quality care, at home. As healthcare costs have increased, the patient’s home has become incredibly important as a site of care.

Yet, patients recovering at home are highly underserved. Patients can only get better at home if they receive the high-quality care that they need reliably. The existing in-home care process involves a patchwork of different vendors, all connected through faxes and phone calls. We’re building modern, robust software that solves this challenge. We currently operate across 49 states with most of the largest health systems in the US.

We’re backed by some of the best investors in technology and healthcare and have ambitious expansion plans. It’s a particularly exciting time to join the company as we’re aggressively expanding the team.

This role is based out of our NYC (Chelsea) office, where we typically work 4x/week. The compensation for this position scales based on experience.

Warning : if you're outside of the Americas timezone, unfortunately, we're only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.

Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we're the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we're also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.

Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We're an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We're a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling. Whether it's a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team's traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We're working to bring these experiences to more of the world.



As an engineer, you'll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You'll be expected to:







This position is a full-time role reporting to the co-founders at Wanderlog.
















We're an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel's something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week's work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.

Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.

We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.



We'll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we'll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We'll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.



Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents' work more productive.

Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.

Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times ) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool) .

At Netflix, we want to entertain the world and are constantly innovating how entertainment is imagined, created, and delivered to a global audience. Engineering teams within Netflix work hard every day to scale and innovate content production and member experiences in an ever-growing complex software landscape.

Content Engineering (CE) builds the products and services used by our internal and external creative partners to create, launch, and promote our global content and ads. Our products enable the entire workflow of content creation, from pitch to play, and provide innovative new ways to develop and manage entertainment at scale.

Content Infrastructure & Solutions (CIS) empowers engineers in CE working on content and studio applications to be innovative and agile in supporting our massive global content production needs. We do that by providing scalable and resilient infrastructure to address integrated large-scale media, assets, data, workflow, and communication use cases.

The Content MiddleWare Infrastructure team (MWI), part of the Content Infrastructure & Solutions group, provides Studio and Content Engineering-specific, highly leveraged, and fully managed data, workflow, and messaging and communication platforms that facilitate the goal of the Connected Studio. To learn more about what the MWI team does, check out the following tech blogs: workflow (1, 2), search (1, 2, 3), and data movement (1, 2).

We are hiring a Full Stack Engineer for the MWI team in the US to take on the following responsibilities:





You are self-motivated and can work independently, while also being able to partner closely with other engineers on a project. You are passionate about building quality products and want to own development end-to-end, leading with the right architecture, and following sound engineering principles to deliver maintainable, performant, and highly developer-friendly experience. You are a problem solver and like to challenge yourself, but you are not afraid to reach out when you need help and enjoy helping other engineers.





You’re not afraid to work full stack, and have a solid frontend skill set. We typically use Java on the backend and Typescript/React + GraphQL on the frontend, but we understand that good engineers can work in many different languages and frameworks. As a full stack engineer you should be comfortable turning ideas into usable, useful user interfaces and implementing backend API endpoints and integrations.



To effectively build operational tooling, you should know what it’s like to operate a service yourself. Likewise, the reliability of operational tooling needs to be incredibly high since these are tools that other engineers rely on to tell them if something is going wrong and to troubleshoot issues. Random frontend bugs or unreliable data can make it difficult for engineers using your tools to troubleshoot issues.



Building services and tooling for other engineers to consume is a bit different than building a line of business applications or standard microservices. A strong platform and infrastructure mindset, long-term thinking, and the ability to understand what other engineers need will set you up for success in this role.



This means you are dedicated to writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and efficient. You understand the importance of comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and prevent future issues. You strive for optimal performance in your code, focusing on speed and resource efficiency. Your commitment to these principles helps create robust and scalable systems that other engineers can depend on and build upon with confidence.

Warning : if you're outside of the Americas timezone, unfortunately, we're only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.

Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we're the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we're also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.

Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We're an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We're a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling. Whether it's a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team's traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We're working to bring these experiences to more of the world.



As an engineer, you'll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You'll be expected to:







This position is a full-time role reporting to the co-founders at Wanderlog.
















We're an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel's something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week's work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.

Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.

We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.



We'll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we'll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We'll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.



Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents' work more productive.

Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.

Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times ) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool) .

We’re building the software infrastructure that enables hospital-quality care, at home. As healthcare costs have increased, the patient’s home has become incredibly important as a site of care.

Yet, patients recovering at home are highly underserved. Patients can only get better at home if they receive the high-quality care that they need reliably. The existing in-home care process involves a patchwork of different vendors, all connected through faxes and phone calls. We’re building modern, robust software that solves this challenge. We currently operate across 49 states with most of the largest health systems in the US.

We’re backed by some of the best investors in technology and healthcare and have ambitious expansion plans. It’s a particularly exciting time to join the company as we’re aggressively expanding the team.

In your role, you will work on products that help us scale our understanding of our vendor landscape within Netflix, and deliver security guidance to internal customers and stakeholders with an emphasis on effectively surfacing context to drive down risk and toil. You will work cross-functionally with partner teams and stakeholders, including software and security engineers, product managers, and internal workforce customers.

Warning : if you're outside of the Americas timezone, unfortunately, we're only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.

Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we're the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we're also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.

Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We're an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We're a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling. Whether it's a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team's traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We're working to bring these experiences to more of the world.


As an engineer, you'll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You'll be expected to:







This position is a full-time role reporting to the co-founders at Wanderlog.















We're an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel's something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week's work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.

Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.

We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.


We'll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we'll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We'll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.


Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents' work more productive.

Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.

Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times ) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool) .

While the tech world obsesses over digital interactions, most of our economy still runs on millions of in-person sales and service conversations happening daily across the U.S. Unlike Zoom calls, these conversations weren't historically recorded – leaving petabytes of rich data untapped. Until now.

Companies in hundreds of industries rely on frontline salesforces working in-person, yet they've operated with zero visibility into these critical customer interactions. Meanwhile, sales productivity follows a stark Pareto distribution – the vast majority of commissions accumulate to a small percentage of top performers, leaving millions of salespeople struggling to achieve financial freedom.

With Siro, we're democratizing sales excellence. Our customers see their reps closing up to 40% more deals, all while gaining unprecedented insights from field conversations.

We've built an intelligence platform that captures, processes, and derives actionable insights from in-person sales and service conversations. Our customers span diverse industries – home improvement, home services (HVAC, plumbing), retail, B2B distribution, insurance, hospitality, and more.

With over $75M in backing from world-class investors, we're on a mission to make field sales the most accessible path to financial freedom.

Our product is already making waves - 4.8 stars on the App Store (700+ ratings), 5.0 stars on G2 (25 reviews), and partnerships with industry leaders like ServiceTitan (NASDAQ: TTAN).

Responsibilities Own the Frontend Experience: Design, build, and refine the core frontend architecture and components that power Runloop’s AI development environment. Identify areas of fragility or opportunity in the frontend codebase and make improvements before they become bottlenecks.

Fullstack Contributions: While your primary focus will be frontend, you’ll also contribute across the stack to ensure smooth data flow, robust integrations, and great developer ergonomics.

Be Customer Obsessed: Help tackle open issues affecting real users—triaging, fixing, and improving with speed and empathy.

Collaborate Closely: Work directly with product, design, and backend engineers to ship features quickly and thoughtfully.

Qualifications Strong experience with modern JavaScript frameworks (React preferred) and frontend architecture.

Solid computer science fundamentals; a CS degree is preferred but not required.

3+ years of experience, ideally with time spent at multiple startups.

Demonstrated ownership—whether through impactful roles at early-stage companies, zero-to-one building in more established tech brands, or polished side projects.

While the tech world obsesses over digital interactions, most of our economy still runs on millions of in-person sales and service conversations happening daily across the U.S. Unlike Zoom calls, these conversations weren't historically recorded – leaving petabytes of rich data untapped. Until now.

Companies in hundreds of industries rely on frontline salesforces working in-person, yet they've operated with zero visibility into these critical customer interactions. Meanwhile, sales productivity follows a stark Pareto distribution – the vast majority of commissions accumulate to a small percentage of top performers, leaving millions of salespeople struggling to achieve financial freedom.

With Siro, we're democratizing sales excellence. Our customers see their reps closing up to 40% more deals, all while gaining unprecedented insights from field conversations.

We've built an intelligence platform that captures, processes, and derives actionable insights from in-person sales and service conversations. Our customers span diverse industries – home improvement, home services (HVAC, plumbing), retail, B2B distribution, insurance, hospitality, and more.

With over $75M in backing from world-class investors, we're on a mission to make field sales the most accessible path to financial freedom.

Our product is already making waves - 4.8 stars on the App Store (700+ ratings), 5.0 stars on G2 (25 reviews), and partnerships with industry leaders like ServiceTitan (NASDAQ: TTAN).

Role Description

In your role as a Robotics C++ Software Engineer at Horizon Surgical Systems, you will contribute to the architecture and design of a cutting-edge surgical robotics system, implementing and verifying mission-critical software modules. The ability to enforce deterministic timing, and fail-safe behaviors, in the controls software is paramount to its clinical efficacy and regulatory approval. You will be responsible for supporting a robotic system with EtherCAT servo drives and redundant control-diagnostic checks, and so you will be debugging issues with peripheral hardware, Linux kernel latency, and real-time safety (e.g., avoiding dynamic memory allocation). Working closely with hardware and the Mechanical Engineering team, you will work to bring up new peripherals, and you will need to consider the fail-safe implications in the event of motor controller failure. Your development and testing will be performed primarily with Linux, but familiarity with embedded architectures and other software stacks will be useful for development of future generations of hardware.

Mixpanel is an event analytics platform for builders who need answers from their data at their fingertips—no SQL required. When everyone in the organization can see and learn from the impact of their work on product, marketing, and company revenue metrics, they are poised to make better decisions.

Over 9,000 paid customers, including companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Sweetgreen, and Samsara, use Mixpanel to understand their customers and measure progress. Our commitment is to provide the most comprehensive and reliable analytics platform accessible and trusted by all.

We are actively recruiting for multiple Software Engineers across different levels for our org!



Mixpanel engineering is a small team that works quickly, prioritizing getting value to customers and iterating to make those experiences

even

better. We offer the most powerful product analytics tool while still focusing on making the user experience delightful. The full stack engineers have the freedom to move about the stack to deliver value to customers without being blocked by ownership silos. This means doing everything from building snappy UIs and fast and reliable services to leveraging our powerful query engine to get the customers answers that help

them

deliver great products. We are looking for folks who seek to understand and own customer problems, participating in every step of the development life cycle from ideation to delivery and maintenance. We encourage ownership and autonomy—if you see customer pain points, you will be empowered to fix them. There is no ""not my problem"" at Mixpanel. All customer problems are ours to fix. We believe that our UX is a key differentiator, and we invest heavily in UI, aiming for a snappy and intuitive experience. We believe in Product-Led Growth, that even enterprise adoption of software tools starts with individual users and the way to get there is through creating a user experience that gets customers to answers quickly.



At Mixpanel Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) work closely in pods to define the product and experiences. You'll be collaborating closely with your EPD team to create a vision for delightful and intuitive UX, then work to deliver the most impactful features for our customers. You'll be owning key pieces of the product, maintaining them, and always advocating for improvements to make the user experience even better, adding to our growing shared components library and expanding our design system. You’ll be working on our web app, which is built in Python, running Django, with an open source JavaScript framework running the front end. Everything is run on Google Cloud Platform, using Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services.

A typical project requires working across our stack, creating endpoints for your feature as well as developing and deploying the UI. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect.

A way for customers to share their metrics publicly, a pain point for customers who want to easily share their data on social media or with executive leadership. This feature required keeping an eye on security so unintentional data would not be leaked for customers, but would enable easier collaboration.

We rebuilt our Live View from the ground up and rebranded to Events. Our goal was to improve users’ trust and make debugging their data and query results easier. With these goals in mind, we removed a number of limitations from Live View, improved key work flows, and tightened the UX. We also drastically simplified both the back-end and front-end architecture resulting in a more performant and maintainable product. The end result is a more powerful tool for our users and a simpler codebase for our developers.

We revamped our dashboards UI to improve the workflow for creating and saving analyses that also had the nice side effect of making our data model clearer. This required us to iterate and polish while learning more about how customers used and worked around our product in their day to day. We applied these learnings to smooth our workflows even more while continuing to set the stage for more series of improvements.

We redesigned our query builder to allow users to instantly see the results of their changes on one screen. This was required balancing competing requirements of visual space for the query builder and the ability to see two things at once, resulting in a more intuitive UX.

We made segmentation faster allowing users to customize what they can compare at the query time vs deciding everything they will ever need at the time they develop your product.

What We're Looking For

We are hiring full stack engineers at all levels across all teams. You take ownership of problems with a focus on delivering value to users/customers. You can deliver solutions that are pragmatic in approach. You have experience with web application architecture and principles.
