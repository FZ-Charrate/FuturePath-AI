[],[],set(),0,Software Engineer,Wanderlog,United States,"This is a remote position.
Warning : if you're outside of the Americas timezone, unfortunately, we're only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.

Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we're the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we're also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.

Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We're an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We're a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling. Whether it's a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team's traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We're working to bring these experiences to more of the world.



As an engineer, you'll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You'll be expected to:







This position is a full-time role reporting to the co-founders at Wanderlog.
















We're an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel's something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week's work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.

Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.

We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.



We'll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we'll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We'll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.



Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents' work more productive.

Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.

Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times ) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool) . The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers' lives easier!"

Slack breaks down communication silos inside and beyond your organization by bringing teams and tools together around common goals, projects and processes in channels and in Slack Connect. It removes the limits of physical walls, giving people the flexibility to do their best work where, when and how they prefer with features like huddles and clips.

You might not have heard of us yet - that's OK, you've found us now - come and find out more about our journey...

Founded in 2017, Laka set out to transform insurance by connecting passionate cyclists to form a collective and protect their bikes for when things go wrong - a better model for insurance was born. For once people come first in insurance by fairly sharing the cost amongst each other. We exist to rewrite the rules of insurance so it's something people stand with, not against.

Our model: Laka makes sure everything runs smoothly for The Collective - from exceptionally fast claims, splitting the cost fairly, guaranteeing a maximum price and all the other heavy lifting of a regulated insurance business. For that service, the collective pays Laka a fee relative to the claims in a month.

Take a closer look at exactly what this means and how it works here.

What have we been up to since then...?

In a nutshell, we've been very busy! Here are a few of the massive achievements we've had:

🚀 Raised an awesome Series A investment round of over $20m

🚀 Grown the team to over 60 Lakanauts, based across the UK and NL, enabling a choice-based, remote-first way of working

🚀 Launched Laka in multiple European countries, essentially helping more people in more places!

🚀 Captured the UK and NL enthusiast cyclist market and expanded into commercial business partnering

🚀 Been awarded 'Best Cycle Insurance Provider' (for the past 6 years in a row - go us! 🥳)

🚀 Opened 3 shiny new offices in London, Bristol & Amsterdam to provide spaces for people to collaborate as they like

Help us continue to change an outdated industry...

We're growing real fast on our path to make the Laka collective model the industry standard and we're expanding across segments, products, and territories. We're looking for innovative, bold and brave minds to help us build the world's best insurance company.





Our Engineering team are at the heart of how Laka's platform is built and operated - their mission being to fix, build and grow. The current team is made up of 12 superstars working in squads in fortnightly sprints, and as Laka continues to expand and pace, we need to add more firepower to the party!

We're searching for passionate and capable engineers who want to work on something that's more than ‘just another app'. We're changing the way things are done, and the way people feel about insurance - through a team of great people coming together to build great software.

We don't expect you to know everything when you join (or ever, in fact) - we encourage you to learn as you go, through training and mentoring, so you can develop existing skills and learn new ones.

We're a small, remote-first, team, if you come to work with us then the role will grow with and around your experience, personal goals and professional development.

Our full-stack includes: Node.js, Golang, MySQL, React, Redux, GraphQL (Apollo), gRPC (protobufs), ActiveMQ, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP, MongoDB, and Redis.











we're remote-first, so we're happy for this role to be based anywhere in the UK, with occasional travel to our London or Bristol offices.







Before you apply, please make sure that you currently have the right to work in the UK (we're really sorry, but we're not able to provide visa sponsorship for this role).





🏠 you choose whether you work from home or our beautiful offices in London & Bristol (we have no minimum expectation of how many days you come in, although we'd love to see your friendly face!)

📈 we want you to be rewarded for Laka's success - everyone in the business is granted share options when they join

if the company hits its targets, you'll get an annual cash bonus

25 days holiday (plus bank holidays), with the option to roll over up to 5 days per year

Laka pays 3% of your base salary into your pension to help you save for the future

we'll give you individual private cover, with the option to add partners & dependants too (at a small cost)

🖥 in addition to letting you choose the kit you want (MacBook or Windows laptop, plus additional equipment like screens, keyboard, etc), we'll also give you a one-off budget of £200 to get anything else you want in order to make your homeworking environment a comfortable place to be

£15 on the first Wednesday of each month to enjoy lunch on Laka - pop out locally with people in the office, or order-in at home, the choice is yours

we love getting everyone together as much as possible - expect regular events throughout the year, for team building, bonding, and general good old-fashioned fun!

as if quarterly company events weren't enough, we also give each office a budget for a monthly social activity (think anything from low-key dinner & drinks through to adventure golf, paddleboarding, bowling, electric darts, trampoline parks and more!)

👚we'll give you some lovely Laka kit to get you started, including a jumper & t-shirts so you can feel (& look) like part of the family

for all you cyclists, we'll give you £10 credit per month towards insuring your bike(s) with us - plus give you access to a bunch of cycling industry discounts

To learn more about what the MWI team does, check out the following tech blogs: workflow (1, 2), search (1, 2, 3), and data movement (1, 2).

We are hiring a Full Stack Engineer for the MWI team in the US to take on the following responsibilities:





You are self-motivated and can work independently, while also being able to partner closely with other engineers on a project. You are passionate about building quality products and want to own development end-to-end, leading with the right architecture, and following sound engineering principles to deliver maintainable, performant, and highly developer-friendly experience. You are a problem solver and like to challenge yourself, but you are not afraid to reach out when you need help and enjoy helping other engineers.





You’re not afraid to work full stack, and have a solid frontend skill set. We typically use Java on the backend and Typescript/React + GraphQL on the frontend, but we understand that good engineers can work in many different languages and frameworks. As a full stack engineer you should be comfortable turning ideas into usable, useful user interfaces and implementing backend API endpoints and integrations.



To effectively build operational tooling, you should know what it’s like to operate a service yourself. Likewise, the reliability of operational tooling needs to be incredibly high since these are tools that other engineers rely on to tell them if something is going wrong and to troubleshoot issues. Random frontend bugs or unreliable data can make it difficult for engineers using your tools to troubleshoot issues.



Building services and tooling for other engineers to consume is a bit different than building a line of business applications or standard microservices. A strong platform and infrastructure mindset, long-term thinking, and the ability to understand what other engineers need will set you up for success in this role.



This means you are dedicated to writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and efficient. You understand the importance of comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and prevent future issues. You strive for optimal performance in your code, focusing on speed and resource efficiency. Your commitment to these principles helps create robust and scalable systems that other engineers can depend on and build upon with confidence.





Inclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner.

We are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, age, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic makeup, marital status, or military service.

Warning : if you're outside of the Americas timezone, unfortunately, we're only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.

Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we're the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we're also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.

Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We're an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We're a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling. Whether it's a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team's traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We're working to bring these experiences to more of the world.



As an engineer, you'll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You'll be expected to:







This position is a full-time role reporting to the co-founders at Wanderlog.
















We're an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel's something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week's work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.

Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.

We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.



We'll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we'll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We'll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.



Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents' work more productive.

Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.

Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times ) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool) . The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers' lives easier!"

While you'll have autonomy in your work, you'll also partner closely with our Operations and Marketing teams to ensure our tools stay effective, efficient, and user-friendly.

This role isn't currently focused on rapid scaling or constant feature development—it's more about thoughtful maintenance, steady improvement, and supporting existing systems that are already in place.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.



The Onboarding team's mission is to make it fast and easy for large users to get enabled and stay enabled on Stripe.

What you’ll do

You’ll build full stack features that make it fast and easy for Stripe users to create their accounts, get their accounts approved to process live mode payments, and keep their accounts enabled over time as requirements change.

This role in particular will focus on building onboarding flows that target high-priority markets in East Asia. It’s important that our onboarding flows are well suited to local regulations and user experience expectations, and you’ll be one of a small team of critical engineers doing that work.






Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.











Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $170,400 - $255,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

As we build out our product vision we need developers who share our passion for solving real-life problems using the craft they love.

Who do we think would be a good fit for this role: Someone familiar with Bootstrap & other modern web development frameworks. We dont consider number of years to be a true indicator of experience; some people achieve in 6 months what others take 6 years to achieve.

Strong understanding of JavaScript, its quirks, and workarounds. Familiarity with AngularJS is a plus. However, even if youre comfortable with JavaScript, and have a desire to learn, were golden.

Someone who is highly detail oriented. You should have the drive to take responsibility & make sure the UI works as expected.

Someone who can take ownership and can operate in an environment of autonomy and freedom.

What would a typical week, in the shoes of a developer, look like: Discuss the spec with the Designer/Product Manager. Understand the problem being solved. Question why a certain approach is being taken. Bring a fresh perspective to the table. Be aware. Convince, or be convinced.

Look at the design mockups (or wireframes). Understand the user interactions that need to be put in place. Fill the gaps intelligently, which means we wont be speccing out the obvious stuff (form validations, error messages, standard UI transitions, etc).

Key job responsibilities

Deliver software features and improvements to major portions of your team's front-end software, including new development, refactoring, and deprecation work

Design and implement software solutions to enable new features or improve existing software

Work closely with customers, UX designers, product managers, and peers to understand business and customer value

Demonstrate operational excellence in all work, including identifying and resolving root causes of operational issues

Actively participate in code reviews, providing meaningful feedback to team members

Mentor and help develop junior team members and interns

A day in the life

As an FEE 2 at Amazon, your day is filled with diverse and engaging activities. You typically start by diving into coding, implementing new features or improving existing ones with high-quality, efficient front-end code. Throughout the day, you participate in code reviews, offering constructive feedback to your teammates and ensuring you all maintain high standards. Collaboration is a big part of your role - you work closely with UX designers, product managers, and backend engineers to understand requirements and integrate the front-end with APIs. You contribute to software design discussions, create technical designs for your assigned tasks, and write unit tests to ensure code reliability.

You're also involved in operational support, keeping an eye on system health and jumping in to resolve any production issues that arise. You make sure to update documentation as you implement changes and often find yourself mentoring junior engineers or interns. Project management is part of your responsibilities too - you update task statuses, estimate efforts for upcoming work, and participate in sprint planning and retrospectives.

You're always learning, staying updated on the latest front-end technologies and sharing knowledge with your team. You focus on performance optimization, ensuring the front-end is as fast and efficient as possible. Accessibility and internationalization are also key considerations in your work, as you strive to create the best possible user experience for all customers. While your specific tasks might vary depending on current projects and priorities, you work independently on most tasks, seeking guidance when you encounter particularly complex challenges or architectural decisions. It's a dynamic role that keeps you engaged and growing every day.

Leveraging past decisions while seeking innovation, we avoid storing customer data and instead focus on surfacing authoritative data sources. Our team of software development managers and engineers works diligently to enhance the STA application and its underlying platform.

We support the broader organization through regular office hours, engaging with external teams, and following best practices around code reviews, testing, and operational excellence.

A day in the life

As an FEE 2 at Amazon, your day is filled with diverse and engaging activities. You typically start by diving into coding, implementing new features or improving existing ones with high-quality, efficient front-end code. Throughout the day, you participate in code reviews, offering constructive feedback to your teammates and ensuring you all maintain high standards. Collaboration is a big part of your role - you work closely with UX designers, product managers, and backend engineers to understand requirements and integrate the front-end with APIs. You contribute to software design discussions, create technical designs for your assigned tasks, and write unit tests to ensure code reliability.

You're also involved in operational support, keeping an eye on system health and jumping in to resolve any production issues that arise. You make sure to update documentation as you implement changes and often find yourself mentoring junior engineers or interns. Project management is part of your responsibilities too - you update task statuses, estimate efforts for upcoming work, and participate in sprint planning and retrospectives.

You're always learning, staying updated on the latest front-end technologies and sharing knowledge with your team. You focus on performance optimization, ensuring the front-end is as fast and efficient as possible. Accessibility and internationalization are also key considerations in your work, as you strive to create the best possible user experience for all customers. While your specific tasks might vary depending on current projects and priorities, you work independently on most tasks, seeking guidance when you encounter particularly complex challenges or architectural decisions. It's a dynamic role that keeps you engaged and growing every day.

How hard? 147,887 lines of Ruby/Rails. 50,086 lines of AngularJS. And 106 tables in Postgres. All working in tandem, to convert a complex offline process into a few effortless clicks.

And yes, we know that . All were saying is that, as a developer, youll be dealing with a large, complex product. With real users, bug reports, and production issues. Dirty code written today, is going to bite you in the ass, six months down the line.

As we build out our product vision we need developers who share our passion for solving real-life problems using the craft they love.

Who do we think would be a good fit for this role: Someone familiar with Bootstrap & other modern web development frameworks. We dont consider number of years to be a true indicator of experience; some people achieve in 6 months what others take 6 years to achieve.

Strong understanding of JavaScript, its quirks, and workarounds. Familiarity with AngularJS is a plus. However, even if youre comfortable with JavaScript, and have a desire to learn, were golden.

Someone who is highly detail oriented. You should have the drive to take responsibility & make sure the UI works as expected.

Someone who can take ownership and can operate in an environment of autonomy and freedom.

What would a typical week, in the shoes of a developer, look like: Discuss the spec with the Designer/Product Manager. Understand the problem being solved. Question why a certain approach is being taken. Bring a fresh perspective to the table. Be aware. Convince, or be convinced.

Look at the design mockups (or wireframes). Understand the user interactions that need to be put in place. Fill the gaps intelligently, which means we wont be speccing out the obvious stuff (form validations, error messages, standard UI transitions, etc).

Innoviti’s aim is to fuel India’s growth by helping drive a cashless economy. We believe this will release a tremendous amount of money in the Indian market that will ease the availability of credit to fuel entrepreneurship, create jobs and improve the living standards of every Indian. Only technology and a talented team that can put technology to use can address this tough problem.

Innoviti is a well-funded company backed by marquee investors such as Titan Company (JV between Tata Group and TIDCO) and Catamaran Ventures (founded by Mr. N. R. Narayana Murthy) and NIIC, Canada. The company has been winner of several awards including Deloitte fastest growing company in APAC award three years in a row and Red Herring award twice. We hold 4 patents with 7 more in pipeline.

Our business involves developing products that use technology to remove friction in a) the supply of money (credit) and b) movement of money. These seemingly simple objectives are actually very tough problems. Today less than 7% of entrepreneurs get access to capital to grow. Less than 8% of purchases happen through electronic money. Solving these tough problems in sustainable ways that are scalable and profitable is a tough challenge!

To address these problems we have built some remarkable products such as uniPAY and smelending.com that today process more than Rs 10,000 Cr. of transactions annually. Leading customers such as Reliance Retail, Lifestyle, Yatra, Indigo, Inox, Tanishq, BPCL, WalMart are using these products. What makes us feel really proud is how cleverly we have used technology to make short-term credit available to more than 24,000 small businesses. Without technology, the challenges in supplying credit to this segment was not profitable for lenders and these businesses were unable to grow.

If our track record is anything to go by, we have already made a small dent in the world of payments! We are now looking for enhancing our team with talented individuals who are ready to address more complex challenges and make a bigger dent!
